## Natural Language to SQL AI Assistant

## 🧐 Overview

This project is a Streamlit web application that acts as a natural language query assistant for a PostgreSQL database. It allows users to ask questions in plain English, which are then translated into SQL queries by an AI agent. The agent executes the queries and returns the results in a conversational format.

## ✨ Features

- **Natural Language Querying**: Ask questions in plain English to get data from the database.
- **AI Agent Integration**: Uses LangChain and a local LLM to reason, plan, and execute SQL queries.
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains chat history to answer follow-up questions.
- **Local Deployment**: Runs entirely locally using LM Studio for the LLM and a PostgreSQL database.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 🐍**
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive web application UI.
- **LangChain**: The framework for building the AI agent and its tools.
- **LLM**: A large language model run locally using LM Studio.
- **SQLAlchemy**: The Python SQL toolkit for database interaction.
